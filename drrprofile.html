                positive impact.</p>
              <p>Arun's Rotaract journey began in 2015-2016 as a Charter Member and International
                Service Director of the Rotaract Club of CMRIT. His passion and dedication quickly propelled
                him to prominent leadership roles, including Secretary and President of the club during the
                Golden Jubilee Year of Rotaract. Arun is a Charter member of Rotaract Bangalore East and a

                positive change and ensured the smooth functioning of the District.</p>
              <p>Arun's exceptional contributions to the Rotaract movement have been recognized and
                celebrated with numerous awards. He has been honoured with the Outstanding District
                Secretary Award by SEARIC MDIO for two consecutive years, along with accolades such as
                Best Executive Council Member, Memorial Leadership Award, Young Achievers Award, and
                Outstanding District Training Plan. These accolades serve as a testament to his unwavering
                dedication and remarkable achievements. </p>
              <p>Outside of Rotaract, Arun's professional journey has been equally impressive. He
                began as a Founding member of various ventures at a young age, displaying his
                entrepreneurial spirit and drive. Over time, he transitioned into the role of a Community
                Strategy Consultant, working with a diverse range of clients across the globe. Currently, Arun
                holds the role of "Developer Community Manager, India Developer Ecosystem" at Google,
                where he continues to make a significant impact by fostering vibrant developer communities.</p>

                relentless pursuit of excellence make him an inspiring role model for aspiring leaders and
                professionals. His passion for Rotaract and dedication to making a positive difference have
                left a lasting impact on the organisations he has been a part of. We applaud his
